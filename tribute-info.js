    msg: `Indian people love to give their cricket heroes a nickname. As these things go, Rahul Dravid being known as 'The Wall' is pretty much spot on. 'The fortress' could also describe Rahul. Because once, Dravid was set, you needed the bowling equivalent of a dozen cannon firing all at once to blast him down`,

  },
  2: {
    msg: `You cannot give him any bad balls or anything to get off strike... just pressure him early in the right spot. He is not like the other guys who love scoring off every ball, and there is no real weakness in his game either. He is mentally strong. You have just got to bowl well to him early on because he gets himself really set for a big innings once he is in`,
